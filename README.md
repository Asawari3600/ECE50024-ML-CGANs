Implementation of Conditional GANs for ECE 50024
This is a simple implementation of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, taking inspiration from the original work published by Mehdi Mirza and Simon Osindero in "Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets" (2014) To run the code, simply download the Python source file and run on Google Colab or on your local machine. For higher accuracy, the number of epochs can be increased.
